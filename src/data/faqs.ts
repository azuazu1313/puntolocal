    question: "How fast do you get started?",
    answer: "We typically begin work within 24-48 hours of your booking. For Google Profile Cleanup and Social Brand Glow-Ups, you'll see the first results within 2-5 business days. Landing pages are delivered within 24-72 hours of receiving your information."
  },
  {
    question: "What info do you need from me?",
    answer: "We'll need basic business information (hours, services, contact details), access to your Google Business Profile and social accounts (if applicable), and any brand assets you already have (logo, photos, etc.). Don't worryâ€”we have a simple onboarding process that makes this easy."
  },
  {
    question: "What if I already have a page/profile?",
    answer: "Perfect! We'll audit what you have, keep what's working, and improve what isn't. Our goal is to optimize your existing assets, not start from scratch unless necessary."
  },
  {
